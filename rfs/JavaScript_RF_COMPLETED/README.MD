# WAREHOUSE OPTIMIZATION

#### *Please do not post your solution to this problem online publically (Git, etc.) Please just keep the solution here on Dropbox.*

## Problem
-----
At ACME warehouse the warehouse manager has observed orders taking a long time to pick and
 believes that moving more popular items to easier to access locations may help.

- Workers pick an order by placing items on a pallet at the dock door.
- Products are stored (inefficiently) in a single aisle with 12 shelves.
- As the shelf number increases, it is located further down the aisle and
  further away from the dock door.
- On average it takes 5*X seconds for a warehouse worker to retrieve an item
  from shelf X and place it on the pallet.
- A warehouse worker can only carry a single item at a time.
- A shelf can only hold one type of item.

*Which items should be on which shelves to optimize picking speed based on
 yesterday's orders?*

## Input
-----
The order repository contains information about yesterdays orders.
Please complete your solution in the **main.js** file provided.

```javascript
function main() {

    var orderRepo = new OrderRepository();
    
    // Your code here

}
```

## Output
-----

Display the shelf and item pairings by calling the following function:

```javascript

```
