// Write a JavaScript program to perform a deep comparison between two

//"Deep equality" means, as you said, "equal keys and equal values." 
//"Strict equality" for objects means "same instance." Strict equality
//implies deep equality, but objects can be deeply equal without being 
//strictly equal.
